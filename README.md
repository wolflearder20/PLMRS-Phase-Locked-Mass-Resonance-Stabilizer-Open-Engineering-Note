# PLMRS — Phase-Locked Mass Resonance Stabilizer (Open Engineering Note)

**Subtitle:** Passive, foundation-embedded approach to seismic resonance control  
**Author:** Spark (`SPARK-NITT`)  
**Status:** v1.0 — Open engineering release

---

## 1. What this repository is

PLMRS (Phase-Locked Mass Resonance Stabilizer) is a **conceptual, research-oriented engineering synthesis** for a passive, foundation-embedded seismic resonance control approach.


This repo is meant to:

- make the concept openly inspectable and discussable,  
- allow qualified engineers and researchers to explore modeling and experiments,  
- clearly state **limits, scope, and liability boundaries**,  
- provide a clean licensing posture for future derivative work.

It is **not** a construction set, not a stamped design, and not project-specific guidance.

---

### For engineers / researchers

If you’re here to assess the concept itself, start with:

- `docs/PLMRS_Engineering_Note_v1.0.md` — conceptual overview, components, and modeling directions (non-normative).
- `docs/PLMRS_Open_Release_and_Liability_v1.0.md` — scope, licensing, and liability framing.

## 2. Critical scope declaration

> PLMRS is presented as a conceptual and research-oriented engineering synthesis.  
>  
> It is **NOT**:  
> - construction documentation  
> - a stamped engineering design  
> - site-specific guidance  
> - a certified safety system  
> - a replacement for licensed professional judgment  
>  
> Any evaluation, modification, testing, or deployment of PLMRS is undertaken solely by the implementing party, who assumes full responsibility for compliance with applicable laws, codes, and standards.

See `docs/PLMRS_Open_Release_and_Liability_v1.0.md` for the full release and liability framing.

## 3. Recommended README disclaimer (for downstream reuse)

Projects or forks that adopt, extend, or experiment with PLMRS are encouraged to include the following **verbatim** disclaimer in their own README:

> **DISCLAIMER**  
>  
> This repository presents a conceptual engineering approach intended for research, discussion, and experimental evaluation only.  
>  
> It is **not** construction documentation, **not** a design specification, and **not** a substitute for licensed professional engineering judgment.  
>  
> Any implementation, testing, or deployment is undertaken solely at the discretion and responsibility of the implementing party, who must comply with all applicable laws, codes, regulations, and safety requirements.  
>  
> The author(s) assume no liability for outcomes resulting from the use or misuse of this material.

## 4. Licensing posture

**Recommended License:** Apache License, Version 2.0

Rationale:

- Explicit “AS IS” and no-warranty clauses  
- Strong liability disclaimers  
- Allows modification, research, and commercial implementation  
- Requires preservation of copyright and attribution  
- Widely accepted by industry, academia, and standards bodies  

This repo therefore ships with:

- `LICENSE` — full Apache License, Version 2.0 text  
- Attribution guidance in `docs/PLMRS_Open_Release_and_Liability_v1.0.md`

A short attribution template for downstream work:

> **Original Concept & Synthesis:** Spark (`SPARK-NITT`)  
> Year: 2025  
>  
> Released under the Apache License, Version 2.0.  
> Derivative works must preserve this notice in accordance with the license.  
> The author(s) bear no responsibility for derivative implementations, interpretations, or outcomes.

## 5. Professional boundary rule

To maintain clear professional boundaries and liability protections, the author does **not**:

- provide stamped drawings or calculations,  
- offer site-specific design advice,  
- claim regulatory or code compliance,  
- guarantee performance or safety outcomes,  
- act as engineer of record for any implementation.

All professional responsibility rests with the implementing engineer(s) or organization(s).

## 6. Repository structure

Minimal v1.0 layout:

- `docs/PLMRS_Open_Release_and_Liability_v1.0.md`  
  Full text of the open release, scope, liability, and licensing guidance.

- `docs/PLMRS_Engineering_Note_v1.0.md`  
  Non-normative concept note describing the PLMRS idea, components, and modeling directions.

  ### Research Framing (Non-Deployable)
  
- `docs/PLMRS_Testable_Claim_v1.0.md`
- The hypothesis stated in measurable terms. (no design/sizing)
  
- `docs/PLMRS_Validation_Ladder_v1.0.md`
- Gated pathway (STOP conditions) to prevent irresponsible deployment.


- `LICENSE`  
  Apache License, Version 2.0.

- `meta/HASHES.md`  
  SHA-256 hashes for the canonical doc(s).

- `meta/NOTARIZATION.md`  
  Notes and placeholders for external timestamping / notarization (e.g., OpenTimestamps).

## 7. Historical context (informative)

This release is comparable to academic preprints and early-stage engineering notes that historically preceded technologies such as:

- tuned mass dampers,  
- base isolation systems,  
- friction damping methods.

Publication of conceptual material does **not** constitute endorsement, instruction, or professional service. It is a contribution to the open engineering conversation, not a turnkey solution.
