# PLMRS — Open Engineering Release & Liability Protection Package v1.0

## 1. Purpose of this document

This document packages the recommended release framing, liability protections, and licensing posture for the **PLMRS (Phase-Locked Mass Resonance Stabilizer)** concept.

It is intended to be used verbatim or near-verbatim when creating a public GitHub repository or similar open engineering publication.

The goal is to:

- enable free advancement and adoption by qualified engineers,  
- preserve authorship credit,  
- explicitly prevent liability transfer to the author,  
- avoid misclassification as professional engineering advice.

---

## 2. Scope declaration (critical)

PLMRS is presented as a **conceptual and research-oriented engineering synthesis**.

It is **NOT**:

- construction documentation,  
- a stamped engineering design,  
- site-specific guidance,  
- a certified safety system,  
- a replacement for licensed professional judgment.

Any evaluation, modification, testing, or deployment of PLMRS is undertaken **solely by the implementing party**, who assumes full responsibility for compliance with applicable laws, codes, and standards.

---

## 3. Recommended README disclaimer (verbatim use)

**DISCLAIMER**

This repository presents a conceptual engineering approach intended for research, discussion, and experimental evaluation only.

It is not construction documentation, not a design specification, and not a substitute for licensed professional engineering judgment.

Any implementation, testing, or deployment is undertaken solely at the discretion and responsibility of the implementing party, who must comply with all applicable laws, codes, regulations, and safety requirements.

The author(s) assume no liability for outcomes resulting from the use or misuse of this material.

---

## 4. Licensing recommendation

**Recommended License:** Apache License, Version 2.0

**Rationale:**

- Explicit “AS IS” and no-warranty clauses  
- Strong liability disclaimers  
- Allows modification, research, and commercial implementation  
- Requires preservation of copyright and attribution  
- Widely accepted by industry, academia, and standards bodies  

This license protects the author while allowing the concept to evolve through responsible engineering practice.

## 5. Apache 2.0 attribution guidance

**AUTHORS / ATTRIBUTION**

Original Concept & Synthesis:  
Spark (`SPARK-NITT`)  
Year: 2025

This work is released under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

Derivative works must preserve this notice in accordance with the license, but the author(s) bear no responsibility for derivative implementations, interpretations, or outcomes.

## 6. Recommended repository language

Suggested README opening paragraph:

> PLMRS (Phase-Locked Mass Resonance Stabilizer) is a passive, foundation-embedded seismic resonance control concept intended to redistribute vibrational energy through distributed, detuned inertial arrays.  
>  
> This repository is released openly to encourage independent evaluation, modeling, testing, and advancement by qualified engineers and researchers.  
>  
> No claims of safety, code compliance, or deployment readiness are made.

---

## 7. Professional boundary rule

To maintain liability protection, the author **must NOT**:

- provide stamped drawings or calculations,  
- offer site-specific design advice,  
- claim regulatory or code compliance,  
- guarantee performance or safety outcomes,  
- act as engineer of record.

All professional responsibility rests with the implementing engineer or organization.

---

## 8. Historical context (optional)

This release is comparable to academic papers, preprints, and early-stage engineering notes that historically preceded tuned mass dampers, base isolation systems, and friction damping technologies.

Publication of concepts does not constitute endorsement, instruction, or professional service.
